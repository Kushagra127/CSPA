                    <br/>

                    <br/>

                    <b>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY </b><br/>

                    JHT may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without advance notice. In the event there are significant changes in the way JHT treats User’s personally identifiable information, or in the Privacy Policy itself, JHT will display a notice on the Website or send Users an email, as provided for above, so that you may review the changed terms prior to continuing to use the Service.
